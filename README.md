I will be going through the process of building a mobile app from the incepetion to deployment. 

The first initiative will begin with user research (UX) where I will interview randomly selected individuals in order to ascertain the needs of the end user. This will begin 9/17 


The second initiative will be creating a user journey so that I can define how they will be interfacing with the app. 9/18


The third initiative will be to create a wire from of the app layout using dribble or pinterest that will stand as a low fidelity mock up 9/19 


When the user journey has been defined and the the mock up has been created, I will have clear view of how the foundation of the application will be built and proceed to creating the initial beta version of the app. 9/20



The final initiative will be to deploy the application on expo in order to test its functionality. 9/21
